# Kotlin Test
This program written in kotlin approximates derivatives using the general rule [f(x+h)-f(x)] / h and is intended as practicing kotlin.
First time using Kotlin. This language is much harder than Java in my opinion - I could not figure out how to change ints to double
without declaring a variable of integer and using .toDouble(). I'm not familiar with Kotlin.
